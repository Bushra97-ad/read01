at the begining i and my classmate learn sth is new in our computer information to leran a new way to creat a markdown page by github,in this way we can easlly creat a new page without any challenges.in this way the page what we want to creat it will be mor coordanite and organized.so it is easyer for beggingers.


 in this paragraph there are many examples about the tools that make a text more tidy e.g
 1. add a link in this way http://github.com - automatic!
[GitHub](http://github.com)
 2. to add a image in this way ![Image of -](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)  
 3. to add  a table in this way First Header | Second Header

Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

 at the end I recommend for the begginars to use this way to creat their markdown without any problems.
